    {
      question: 'Is this therapy?',
      answer: 'The Anxiety Protocol uses evidence-based therapeutic tools within a structured, high-performance training model. While designed and overseen by a trained therapist, it is not traditional, open-ended talk therapy. Our focus is on skill acquisition and measurable results within a fixed 30-day period.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use my insurance to pay for this?',
      answer: 'No. Our program is considered a premium coaching or training service and is not covered by insurance as a conventional therapy.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why is this better than traditional therapy?',
      answer: 'We are not a "better therapy"; we are a different, more intensive model designed for a specific type of mind. For clients who value data, structure, and efficiency, our protocol can achieve in 30 days what might take years in traditional models.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the "Cognitive Simulator"?',
      answer: 'The Cognitive Simulator is our proprietary, voice-based training technology. We do not use the term "AI," as it is associated with low-quality chatbots. Our Simulator is a sophisticated, purpose-built environment for high-repetition psychological skill practice in a completely private, judgment-free space.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I can\'t commit to 2-3 sessions per week?',
      answer: 'The program is designed for high-frequency practice because that\'s what drives rapid results. If you can\'t commit to this schedule, traditional weekly therapy may be a better fit. The protocol requires consistent engagement to achieve the promised outcomes.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I know if I\'m a good fit for this program?',
      answer: 'This protocol is designed for high-achieving professionals who are structured, results-oriented, and psychologically-minded. If you value data over subjective feelings, prefer clear protocols to open-ended processes, and see anxiety as a system to be solved rather than a lifelong condition to manage, this may be for you. Review our "Who It\'s For" page for a complete assessment.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens after the 30 days?',
      answer: 'Our goal is your independence. The final handover session includes a comprehensive go-forward plan based on your results. You\'ll have the skills, data, and protocols you need to maintain your progress autonomously. Some clients choose to engage in periodic "tune-up" sessions, but this is optional, not required.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is my information private and secure?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. Our platform is HIPAA-grade with end-to-end encryption. All sessions are confidential, and your data is stored with the highest security standards. Every simulation transcript is private and accessible only to you and your Clinical Strategist.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I\'m in crisis or have thoughts of self-harm?',
      answer: 'This program is not a crisis service. If you are in acute crisis, experiencing thoughts of self-harm, or have a severe psychiatric condition requiring immediate care, please contact emergency services or a crisis hotline. Our protocol is designed for high-functioning anxiety, not crisis intervention.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you offer payment plans?',
      answer: 'The program is Â£2,500 paid upfront. This investment reflects the intensive nature and accelerated timeline. We do not currently offer payment plans, but you can discuss any financial concerns during your strategic consultation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How many clients do you accept per month?',
      answer: 'We accept a maximum of four new clients per month. This limit ensures that each client receives the highest level of strategic oversight and personalized attention from their Clinical Strategist. Selection is based on fit, not timing.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What should I expect from the strategic consultation?',
      answer: 'The strategic consultation is a brief, no-obligation conversation (typically 15-20 minutes) to determine if the program aligns with your needs and goals. We\'ll discuss your current challenges, your experience with anxiety, and whether the intensive format is appropriate for you. There is no pressure to commit.',
