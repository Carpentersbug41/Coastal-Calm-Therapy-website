## üîÑ After Adding Real Images

### Update the code (Optional - for better performance):

**In `app/(site)/page.tsx`** (line 78):
Change from:
```tsx
<img
  src="/images/hero-plant.svg"
  ...
/>
```

To:
```tsx
<Image
  src="/images/hero-plant.jpg"
  alt="Soft natural greenery by a sunlit window"
  fill
  priority
  className="object-cover rounded-3xl shadow-soft-lg ring-1 ring-black/5 group-hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform duration-500"
/>
```

**In `components/post-card.tsx`** (line 32):
Change from:
```tsx
<img
  src="/images/post-fallback.svg"
  ...
/>
```

To:
```tsx
<Image
  src="/images/post-fallback.jpg"
  alt={post.title}
  width={600}
  height={400}
  className="w-full h-full object-cover transition-transform duration-700 group-hover:scale-110"
/>
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Keep images under 1MB** for fast loading
