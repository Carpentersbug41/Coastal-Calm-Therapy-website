# Why 'Positive Thinking' Fails: The Truth About Your Brain's Panic Alarm

It’s late. You’re in the quiet of your own home, the day’s demands finally behind you. You have a task to finish—some emails, a report, planning for the next day. It’s a familiar and manageable task. You are, by any objective measure, perfectly safe and in control.
And yet, there it is.
It starts not as a thought, but as a purely physical event. A familiar, unwelcome tightness gathering in your chest, like a cold hand squeezing your lungs. A wave of dread, utterly disconnected from the reality of the task at hand, washes through you.
Annoyed, you deploy your usual strategy: firm, logical self-talk. You access the capable, intelligent part of your mind, the part that solves problems and gets things done, and you issue a clear directive.
Come on, just get on with it. You’re nearly done. There is no logical reason to feel this way.
The sensation in your chest doesn’t listen. If anything, it tightens. Your breathing becomes shallow, a frustrating little hitch at the top of each breath that refuses to deliver a full lungful of air.
This physical defiance enrages the logical part of you. The argument escalates, your internal voice turning from firm to frustrated, then contemptuous.
Why are you like this? It’s just a pile of emails. It’s pathetic.
Your heart begins to beat a little faster, a frantic, fluttering rhythm against your ribs.
You just need to get a grip. Stop it.
But you can’t. It’s like shouting instructions into a gale-force wind. The more your rational mind insists on control, the more your body panics. The very act of trying to wrestle the feeling into submission adds a layer of frantic, violent energy to the system. After ten minutes of this silent, exhausting civil war, you are left slumped in your chair, head in your hands, utterly spent. The feeling has not been defeated; it has simply worn you out. You feel hollow, shaky, and now, more certain than ever, that you are fundamentally broken.
This experience wasn’t a failure of willpower. It was a failure of strategy. You were shouting in the wrong language, and in doing so, you were making the problem worse. What if this unwinnable argument isn't your fault? What if you were simply given the wrong tool for the job?

## Meet the Two 'Brains' Co-Piloting Your System

The deep frustration of a logical mind finding itself powerless against a seemingly illogical feeling is one of the most common experiences my clients report. The reason for this failure is simple, but profound: you are trying to send the wrong person to do the job.
It helps to think of it as having two distinct ‘brains’ that are always on, like two different personalities co-piloting your system, each with its own language, logic, and priorities.

### 1. The ‘Thinking Brain’ (The Manager)

This is your prefrontal cortex, the sophisticated, modern part of your mind that resides just behind your forehead. Think of it as a well-meaning, logical, but slightly pedantic office manager. It is a ‘top-down’ system. It speaks the language of words, spreadsheets, evidence, and reason. It believes every problem can be solved with a well-written memo or a firm instruction. It is future-oriented, constantly making plans and assessing risks. It is the part of you that tells you, “There is no reason to feel anxious.” It is a brilliant analyst and planner, but it is a terrible crisis manager.

### 2. The ‘Feeling Brain’ (The Guard Dog)

This is your limbic system, a much older, more primal part of your mind, with the amygdala at its core. Think of it as a pre-verbal, loyal, but highly reactive guard dog. It is a ‘bottom-up’ system. It does not speak in words. Its entire language consists of pure physical sensation, threat, and the drive for survival. It only understands the present moment. It is the part of you that creates the tightness in your chest. Its only job is to bark loudly at the first sign of potential danger.
Your mistake, and the central error of most simplistic "positive thinking" advice, has been sending the Manager to reason with the Guard Dog while it is in the middle of barking at what it perceives to be a home invasion.
The Manager stands there, clipboard in hand, shouting, “According to my records, the premises are secure! There is no intruder! Cease barking immediately!”
The Guard Dog, which only understands the language of threat, doesn’t hear the words. All it senses is the frantic, agitated energy of the shouting, and it interprets this as the Manager panicking too. This confirms its initial assessment: the danger must be real and catastrophic. So, it barks even louder. The Manager, seeing the barking increase, becomes even more desperate and shouts more forcefully, "I said, GET A GRIP!"
This vicious feedback loop is the unwinnable argument. The very effort to ‘get a grip’ and ‘be rational’ becomes another source of internal threat, adding a second layer of frustration and self-blame that serves as fresh fuel for the fire.

## The High Road vs. the Low Road: Your Brain's Two Speeds

The Guard Dog isn’t just speaking a different language; it’s operating on a different timescale. The reason the panic so often feels like an ambush is because your brain is wired for speed when it comes to survival.
As neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux discovered, when your senses pick up a potential threat, the information splits and travels along two parallel paths simultaneously.

*   **The High Road (The "Scenic Route")**: This is the slow, logical path. Information travels from your eyes and ears up to your sophisticated "Thinking Brain" (the prefrontal cortex) for careful, detailed analysis. This road is accurate and considers the context. It’s the part of your brain that can look at a situation and say, “That’s just a pile of emails. We are safe.” It provides a high-definition picture, but it takes time to develop.
*   **The Low Road (The "Motorway")**: This is the fast, instinctive path. It’s a neural super-highway that completely bypasses the logical thinking brain. It sends a crude, low-definition "snapshot" of the potential threat directly to your "Feeling Brain" (the amygdala). Its job is not accuracy; its job is speed. It is designed to react first and ask questions later.

For those of us with a highly sensitised system—what I call a "Faulty Smoke Alarm"—years of stress or past trauma have acted like a massive infrastructure project for the Low Road. It has been widened, paved, and turned into a six-lane motorway with no speed limit.
The panic signal has already travelled down the Low Road, hit the amygdala, and triggered a full-body alarm bell before the information has even reached your logical High Road for analysis. You can't stop the anxiety with logic because, from a neurological perspective, the logic hasn't even arrived at the scene of the accident yet. Your body is already in a state of emergency while your Thinking Brain is still waiting for the full report to download.

## The Hijacked CEO: Why Your Smart Brain Goes 'Stupid'

The alarm doesn't just get there first; it then actively sabotages any attempt by your logical mind to regain control. This is the crucial, final piece of the puzzle.
Think of your prefrontal cortex (PFC) as the Chief Executive Officer of your brain. It resides in the figurative corner office and is responsible for all the high-level executive functions: logical thought, long-term planning, impulse control, and, crucially, emotional regulation.
When the amygdala (the Guard Dog) pulls the fire alarm, it triggers what psychologist Daniel Goleman famously called a "limbic hijack." This hijack floods your entire system with a powerful cocktail of stress hormones, primarily cortisol and adrenaline.
These hormones are incredibly useful if you need to physically outrun a lion; they shut down non-essential functions and divert all resources to raw survival. They are, however, terrible for clear, nuanced cognitive function.
These stress hormones act like a chemical stun gun on your PFC. They actively inhibit its function, impairing its ability to access complex information, weigh options, and make rational decisions.
It's a biological hostage situation. The over-anxious security guard has burst into the boardroom, tasered the CEO, and taken control of the building.
This is not a metaphor; it is a physiological fact. When the CEO is offline, your entire experience of reality shifts. Your thinking becomes rigid and black-and-white. Your perspective narrows to the immediate threat, and you lose the ability to recall past successes or imagine a positive future. You are locked in a timeless, terrifying present.
You can’t ‘think straight’ or ‘be rational’ in the middle of a meltdown because the very part of your brain responsible for rational thought has been temporarily and deliberately taken offline. The system is designed to prioritise raw, animal survival over nuanced, logical analysis.
Your inability to argue your way out of panic isn’t a personal weakness; it’s a sign that a perfectly designed, albeit over-sensitive, survival system is working exactly as it should.

## Become the War Reporter, Not the Soldier

The first step to ending any unwinnable war is to recognise that you are in one. This week’s exercise is not about trying a new tactic to win the fight. It is a diagnostic tool, designed to help you gather the irrefutable, personal evidence you need to finally declare a ceasefire with your own mind.

### Your One Commitment This Week: The Unwinnable Argument Log

Your only job this week is to become a curious, non-judgmental war reporter, documenting the internal battles from a safe distance.

**Your Task:**
The next time you find yourself caught in a spiral, trying to argue with a powerful feeling, your job is to simply get through it as best you can. Then, after the storm has passed and you feel calm and grounded again, take out your notebook. Create two columns.
In Column A ("The Guard Dog's Bark"): Write down the catastrophic thought or core feeling that was present during the spiral. (e.g., “I’m losing control!” “I can’t cope.” “This is too much.”)
In Column B ("The Manager's Argument"): Write down the logical counter-argument your thinking brain was trying to use. (e.g., “Don’t be silly, you’re perfectly fine.” “You’ve handled this before.” “There’s nothing to be afraid of.”)

**Your Analysis:**
At the bottom of the page, answer this one, simple question:
In the heat of the moment, did the logical argument in Column B make the physical feeling better, worse, or have no effect?

**The Goal:** The purpose of this log is not to win the argument. It is to collect the data that proves it is an unwinnable fight, so you can finally give yourself permission to lay down a tool that doesn’t work.

## The Right Tool for a Bottom-Up Problem

You now have the scientific reason for your frustration. Your failure to stop overwhelming anxiety with logic is not a personal failing; it is a biological reality. You have been trying to turn a screw with a hammer, and then blaming yourself when the screw gets mangled.
This understanding is the end of self-blame, but it is the beginning of a new, more skillful approach.
If the problem starts in the body (a ‘bottom-up’ process), then the solution must also start in the body. You need a new toolkit, one that speaks the language of the Guard Dog, not the Manager. You need a set of skills that work at the level of physiology, not just psychology.
This ‘bottom-up’ toolkit is the core of my book, The Faulty Smoke Alarm. It’s a complete, step-by-step training plan to recalibrate your nervous system from the ground up. The book follows the real journey of Rebecca, who, like you, had tried and failed to ‘think her way out of it’, and who learned, step-by-step, how to work with her body to create real, lasting change.
The journey begins with learning the first, foundational ‘bottom-up’ skill. To get started, I want to give you the first three chapters of the book, absolutely free. In them, you will learn how to find your ‘somatic anchor’—the first practical tool for speaking the language of your own body and finding solid ground in the middle of a storm.
