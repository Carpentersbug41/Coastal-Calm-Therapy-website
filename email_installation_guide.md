- Must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to work in browser
- Restart your dev server

### Not receiving emails from Formspree:

- Verify your email is set in Formspree settings
- Check Formspree submission logs in their dashboard

### Emails not added to MailerLite:
- Check the MailerLite API key is correct
- Verify API token has not expired
- Check MailerLite submission logs in their dashboard

### Changes not appearing:
- Always restart your dev server after changing `.env.local`
- Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5)

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Test with real email addresses first** - use your own email to test everything

2. **Set up email templates in MailerLite** - design beautiful branded emails for your subscribers

3. **Monitor your Formspree submissions** - check the dashboard regularly for applications

4. **Create different groups in MailerLite** - separate "blog subscribers" from "program applicants" if you collect those too

5. **Don't commit `.env.local` to Git** - it's already in `.gitignore` but double-check!

6. **Backup your API keys** - save them somewhere secure (password manager)

## üìç Where Are Subscription Boxes?

### ‚úÖ Currently Active:
1. **Every Individual Blog Post** - At the bottom after the content
   - Example: `http://localhost:3001/blog/why-positive-thinking-fails`
   - Located in: `app/(site)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` (lines 188-190)

2. **Blog Listing Page** - At the bottom after all posts
   - URL: `http://localhost:3001/blog`
   - Located in: `app/(site)/blog/page.tsx` (lines 92-97)

3. **Contact Form** - For program applications
   - URL: `http://localhost:3001/contact`
   - Located in: `app/(site)/contact/page.tsx`

### ü§î Should You Add More?

**Homepage Subscription Box?**
- **My Recommendation: NO (for now)**
- Your homepage is optimized for high-value conversions (¬£2,500 program applications)
- Adding a "free stuff" CTA might dilute your main conversion goal
- Instead, your blog brings in free chapter subscribers, then nurtures them toward the program
- This is a better funnel: Blog ‚Üí Free Chapters ‚Üí Email Nurture ‚Üí Program Application

**Dedicated /subscribe Page?**
- **My Recommendation: OPTIONAL**
- You already have a `/subscribe` page at `app/(site)/subscribe/page.tsx`
- But with subscription boxes on all blog pages, it's redundant
- **Keep it** if you want a dedicated landing page for ads or social media
- **Skip it** if you're happy with blog subscriptions only

### üí° Smart Subscription Strategy

Here's the flow I've set up for you:

```
Visitor ‚Üí Blog Post (reads content) ‚Üí Loves it! ‚Üí 
Subscribes for free chapters ‚Üí Gets 3 chapters via email ‚Üí 
MailerLite nurture sequence ‚Üí Decides to apply for program ‚Üí 
/contact page ‚Üí You get application ‚Üí Schedule consultation ‚Üí $$$
```

This is better than putting subscribe boxes everywhere!

## üìä Where Everything Is Located

For reference, here's where the email code lives:

- **Blog subscription box component**: `components/blog-subscribe.tsx`
- **Individual blog post pages**: `app/(site)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` (line 189)
- **Blog listing page**: `app/(site)/blog/page.tsx` (line 95)
- **Contact form**: `app/(site)/contact/page.tsx`
- **Subscribe API**: `app/api/subscribe/route.ts`
- **Contact API**: `app/api/contact/route.ts`
- **Homepage**: `app/(site)/page.tsx` (currently NO subscription box - by design!)
